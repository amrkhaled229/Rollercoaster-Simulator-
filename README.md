# Rollercoaster-Simulator-
Create rollercoaster paths using various algorithms. The game features a keyboard-controlled UI for designing paths with straight sections (DDA Line Algorithm), circular loops (Polar Circle Algorithm), and curved segments (Bresenham Curve Algorithm). Customize path properties, simulate the rollercoaster's motion, and include screen scrolling.
